  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: While the feature appears to work, the broken test suite means its continued
      correctness cannot be guaranteed through automated regression testing.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: No issues identified.
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: The test suite is unreliable, which is a critical reliability issue for
      the project's development process.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Linting issues from the first review were resolved.
recommendations:
  immediate:
  - action: 'Fix 3 failing tests in tests/integration/test_mcp_protocol.py by providing
      a valid mock JWT in the test requests. This is the same recommendation as
      the previous review cycle.'
