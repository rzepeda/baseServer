status_reason: "The initial OAuth middleware placeholder posed a security risk. While mitigated by raising an error, its full implementation is a critical upcoming requirement. Core components like config and logging also lack dedicated unit tests."

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "OAuth middleware is a placeholder and does not perform authentication, posing a risk if other endpoints are added without being secured."
    suggested_action: "Prioritize the full implementation of the OAuth2 middleware and token validation in the next relevant story."
    suggested_owner: "sm"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Key foundational modules (`src/config.py`, `src/utils/logging.py`) lack unit tests."
    suggested_action: "Add unit tests to verify the behavior of the configuration loader and the logging setup."
    suggested_owner: "dev"

nfr_validation:
  security: { status: CONCERNS, notes: "OAuth middleware is a non-functional placeholder. It was refactored to fail-safe, but requires full implementation." }
  performance: { status: PASS, notes: "No immediate performance concerns for this bootstrap story." }
  reliability: { status: PASS, notes: "Explicit error for unimplemented OAuth improves reliability over a silent pass-through." }
  maintainability: { status: PASS, notes: "Code quality and project structure are high, promoting ease of maintenance." }

    - action: "Add unit tests for the logging utility to ensure the structlog processor chain is correctly configured."
