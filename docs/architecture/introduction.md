# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **youtubeagenttranscript**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This is a backend-only MCP server tool with no graphical user interface. All user interaction occurs through Claude/MCP clients (external systems). No separate Frontend Architecture Document is required.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision: N/A**

This is a greenfield Python 3.12+ project using standard project structure conventions. Manual setup will handle MCP SDK integration, tool registry architecture, and all tooling configuration.
