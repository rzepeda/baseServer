Ticket: DEV-104 Title: Enable CORS Support & Update Test Harness for Localhost Inspector Priority: 🔴 High / Blocker Points: 2 Assignee: [Developer Name]

📖 User Story
As a Developer using the MCP Inspector web interface, I want the agentictools.uk server to accept Cross-Origin (CORS) requests and for our test suite to automatically verify this capability, So that I can debug tools visually without browser errors and ensure we don't accidentally break this connectivity in future deployments.

🚧 Context & Problem
The Issue: The Web Inspector (http://localhost:6274) fails to connect to the remote server because of missing CORS headers.

The Gap: Our current mcp_test_suite.sh passed successfully because curl does not enforce CORS by default. We have a "false positive" in our testing pipeline.

✅ Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
Preflight Success: The server responds with HTTP 200 to OPTIONS requests originating from http://localhost:6274.

Headers Present: The response headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin.

Inspector Connection: The MCP Inspector connects successfully in "Direct" mode.

Test Script Update (Crucial): The mcp_test_suite.sh file has been updated to include a CORS Simulation Test.

Requirement: The script must send a request with -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" and fail if the response does not contain the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

🛠 Technical Notes
Server Implementation: Use CORSMiddleware in FastAPI/Starlette before route definitions.

Test Script Implementation: You can use curl -I -X OPTIONS to inspect headers without downloading the body.

📋 Sub-Tasks
[ ] Add CORS Middleware to server.py.

[ ] Verify connectivity manually via Inspector.

[ ] Update mcp_test_suite.sh with a new test case (Test #3) that mocks a browser Origin request.

[ ] Run the new test suite against the fixed server to confirm it passes.
