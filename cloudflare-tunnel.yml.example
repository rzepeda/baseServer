# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration Example
#
# This is a template for configuring a named Cloudflare Tunnel for the MCP server.
# Copy this file to `cloudflare-tunnel.yml` and replace the placeholders with your actual values.
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit `cloudflare-tunnel.yml` to version control as it contains
# your tunnel UUID and credentials path.

# Your tunnel UUID (obtained from `cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel-name>`)
tunnel: <your-tunnel-uuid>

# Path to your tunnel credentials file (typically in ~/.cloudflared/)
credentials-file: /home/<your-username>/.cloudflared/<your-tunnel-uuid>.json

# Ingress rules define how traffic is routed to your local services
ingress:
  # Route traffic from your public hostname to the local MCP server
  - hostname: mcp.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8080

  # Catch-all rule (required) - returns 404 for unmatched hostnames
  - service: http_status:404

# Optional: Enable logging for debugging
# loglevel: debug

# Optional: Configure HTTP settings
# originRequest:
#   noTLSVerify: false  # Set to true only for development with self-signed certs
#   connectTimeout: 30s
#   tcpKeepAlive: 30s
